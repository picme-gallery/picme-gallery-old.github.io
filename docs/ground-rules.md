# Ground Rules

* What is each team member's contact info, that the rest of the team can use to reach the members of the team?
> Phone numbers include: Alex (505-903-9004), Shayan (801-833-5080), Isaac (575-200-2434)

* What are the core practices you will use to coordinate your work as a team?
> Check in every day via Zoom around 6:30 P.M. (We can change the time, just communicate via Slack between class breaks.)
During check-in decide tasks and who will complete what task.
Send a message to each other updating each other’s progress by 8:30 P.M. every night on Slack.
Ask for help/ clarification via Slack, text, or phone call if you get stuck and need help.
Everyone will help each other out as best as we can via all forms of communication.
Please communicate your needs and grievances with each other as soon as possible through Slack or text.


* How will development tasks be chosen/assigned/accepted?
> Tasks will be evenly divided and assigned during check-in, and will be based on each team members' strengths and availability. At the end of check-in we will review the assigned tasks and make sure that everyone knows what they need to get done for the night. 

* What practices do intend to use for resolution of conflicts?
> First, we will sit-down and have a short meeting to communicate what the conflict is. Then we will work to resolve the issue quickly as a team. More specifically, if conflicts continue then they will be resolved democratically via a required majority ⅔ vote to proceed.
